            "summary": "Cancer cells are generally induced by activated photo-oncogenes — genes that when mutated cause normal cells to become cancer cells. The mutated version of photo-oncogenes is termed “oncogenes” and it disrupts cell regulation by promoting cell proliferation, inhibit cell differentiation, and halt cell death. So, how does photo-oncogene become oncogene? Oncogene is a result of high expression level of mutations in proto-oncogene. Genetic mechanism that can induce oncogene activation includes: 1) Point mutation, deletion, insertions that leads to a hyperactive gene 2) Point mutation, deletion, insertion in the promoter region that leads to aberrant transcription 3) Gene amplifications events producing extra chromosomal copies of proto-oncogene 4) Chromosomal translocation events that relocate proto-oncogene to a new chromosomal site that leads to higher expression 5) Chromosomal translocations that lead to a fusion between a proto-oncogene and a second gene, which produces a fusion protein with oncogenic activity. It is important to note that cancer is most likely to be a multistep process during which cells acquire series of mutations that collectively lead to increased proto-oncogene function. Thus, targeting specific oncogene is never enough to defeat cancer due to the complex nature of its formation in the first place.",
