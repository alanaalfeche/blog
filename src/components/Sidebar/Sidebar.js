                I participated in a software engineering boot camp for six months before starting my career as a Software/Data Engineer. My previous experience as a published researcher served me well following the bootcamp as I was tasked with proof-of-concepts projects to explore new Amazon Web Services databases services i.e. Neptune and Aurora. My expertise in databases earned me a nomination to AWS Data Hero in 2019.
